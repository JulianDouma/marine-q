# Unit Tests

This directory contains unit tests that test individual components in isolation.

## Guidelines
- Test single classes or functions
- Mock all dependencies  
- Fast execution (< 100ms per test)
- Many tests (should form the base of the testing pyramid)
- No database, network, or filesystem access
